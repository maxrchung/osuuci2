	<h2>Registration</h2>
	<p>Registrations are open until the end of the June. All players are welcome to apply provided they have the time to play every weekend of the league. We will edit map pools and structure accordingly for the eventual entrants. Note that while you may apply, you are not guaranteed a spot.

      <div id="faq">
	<h2>FAQs</h2>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><u>What are Swiss rounds and how do they work?</u></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>Swiss is a tournament format in which players compete against other players relative to their skill level and tournament performance. The tournament begins by pitting players against others with similar seeding (in this case, determined by osu! ranking). If you win a match, you gain a score point, and if you lose or don't show, you gain no points. In the next Swiss round, two players with similar score points will then match up against each other.</p>
	<p>In this tournament, we will play 10 rounds of Swiss, corresponding to each week. Top players and top player seedings are determined by the highest score points earned from winning matches. Ties are handled by giving preference for victories over higher seeded opponents and total game victories (i.e. losing by 1-2 is better than losing by 0-2).</p>
	<p>While we like the fairness and competitiveness of Swiss, it is not a very spectator friendly format. Many games go on at once, and a champion isn't crowned by beating people through a bracket but rather through longterm performance. As such, we will have separate a single elimination playoffs after the Swiss rounds for a more satisfying finale.</p>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><u>Something came up, and I can't play on one weekend. What can I do?</u></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>By registering for this tournament, you agree to free up a few hours over the weekend for the league. However, unforseen events can happen, and we'll do our best to accommodate for unexpected situations. Contact us as soon as possible if you have a problem. Message us at least a week in advance so we, you, and your opponent have time to talk and reschedule your match.</p>

	<p>If you contact us too late and your opponent declines a match, you will have to forfeit your round for the week. We stress again to also stick to the weekend schedule and only enter the league if you are sure that your weekends are free. Repeat rematches and no shows can lead to your removal from the league.</p>
